# COHHIO_HMIS
Code for pulling in HMIS data, creating custom CoC-level reporting

Files I'm pulling in include:
1. The HUD CSV files. Pulling back to October 1 of two years ago on all providers that have been active since then.
2. "RMisc" found in ART > Public > Ohio Balance of State > COHHIO Only.
3. "Regions" file that simply lists Counties with their Regions.
