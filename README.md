# COHHIO_HMIS
Code for pulling in HMIS data, writing it out to reports

Files I'm pulling in include:
1. Bowman_XML_2018 file, as agreed upon by WellSky. Pulling back to October 1 of two years ago.
2. "County Data Export", as found in SP5's ReportWriter. Modify date range as needed.
3. "EE IDs User Creating", as found in SP5's ReportWriter. Modify date range as needed.
