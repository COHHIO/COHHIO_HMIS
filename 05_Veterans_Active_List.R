# Long Term -------------------------------------------------------

# thinking of moving the code I already wrote for this in the Active List
# up to cohorts.R so I can get this easily from there instead of having to
# copy that code to here

# Chronic ---------------------------------------------------------

# thinking of moving the code I already wrote for this in the Active List
# up to cohorts.R so I can get this easily from there instead of having to
# copy that code to here

# actually maybe not because the chronic code in the active_list.R looks at
# an entire household's chronic status and then marks otherwise-non-chronic
# clients as chronic if they're in a household, but this report only looks at
# veterans. BUT maybe it shouldn't. Like it would make more sense to calculate
# chronicity the same from one report to the other and take into account a 
# veteran's household's chronic status as well.

# ON THE OTHER HAND, it's very specific to the way the Active List is written
# because that script is untangling household data quality issues first and THEN
# calculating it, but I'm not planning to untangle household dq issues in this
# report. Maybe I should untangle household dq issues in cohorts too. AAaaa

# I think it will be best to move the chronic code to cohorts, and the Returns
# code can go there too.

# redundant data elements once this is all done.
