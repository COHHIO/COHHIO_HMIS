## Ohio Balance of State & Mahoning County CoCs

## Prioritization in the Ohio Balance of State CoC

Our 80-county CoC was divided into 17 Homeless Planning Regions by a state agency for grant management purposes, so our Coordinated Entry is decentralized and mostly work through the Planning Region or County level.

Ohio's Balance of State is populated and varied. 

<div class="notes">
It's hard to say a thing and have it apply to the entire geography. It's rural, suburban, and urban. Some places have a shelter, some places don't. In some places there is no PSH. We have only 4 counties covered by PATH Street Outreach.
